      <description>Project Overview: If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a job, say a data science role, you&amp;rsquo;re probably using Linkedin Jobs. But with hundreds of jobs posted every day, it can be hard to find the ones that best match your skills.
The main purpose of this project is to help you find the best matching jobs automatically.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start by scraping job postings from LinkedIn using Selenium, Requests, and BeautifulSoup.
Next, a text analysis of both your resume and LinkedIn jobs will be carried out using Spacy.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Bitcoin closing price series</title>
      <link>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p6-bitcoin_price_forecast/</link>

      <guid>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p6-bitcoin_price_forecast/</guid>
      <description>Project Overview: Time series forecasting is one of the most widely used data science techniques in business and finance to make future strategic decisions.
In this project we will forecast daily closing price series of Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer online currency, using the historical price of Bitcoin.
We will follow different approaches to time series forecasting, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms.
We will start with classical approaches to time series forecasting, including moving averages, exponential smoothing methods and the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.</description>

      <title>Toxic Comment Classification with TensorFlow</title>
      <link>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p5-toxic-comment-classification-with-tensorflow/</link>

      <guid>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p5-toxic-comment-classification-with-tensorflow/</guid>
      <description>Project Overview: Negative online behaviors, like toxic comments, are likely to make people stop expressing themselves and leave a conversation. Platforms struggle to identify and flag potentially harmful or offensive online comments, leading many communities to restrict or shut down user comments altogether.
Kaggle issued a challenge to build a multi-label classification model that&amp;rsquo;s able to detect different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity and insults, and thus help make online discussion more productive and respectful.</description>

      <title>Churn prediction and machine learning at scale with Pyspark and Spark MLlib.</title>
      <link>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p4-sparkify-churn-prediction/</link>

      <guid>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p4-sparkify-churn-prediction/</guid>
      <description>Project Overview: This project is part of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Data Scientist Nanodegree. It focuses on customer churn, a key metric for customer-facing businesses in a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, e-commerce, and streaming services. Predicting churn is critical, as customer retention is the main driver of a companyâ€™s revenue.
For this project, Udacity provided a 12GB dataset of customer activity from Sparkify, a fictional music streaming service similar to Spotify or Pandora.</description>

      <description>This project is part of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Nanodegree Program in collaboration with IBM. The aim of this project is to build a recommendation system for users of the IBM Watson community.
A dataset of 5149 users, 714 articles and about 46K interactions is used to develop this RecSys.
The project is divided into the following sections:
Build an ETL pipeline to extract, clean and load the data to a SQLite database.</description>

      <guid>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p2-disaster-response-project/</guid>
      <description>This project is part of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Nanodegree Program in collaboration with Appen (formally Figure 8). The goal of this project is to build a model for an API that classifies messages received in real time during a disaster event, so that messages can be sent to the correct disaster response agency.
A dataset of thousands of real-world messages during disaster events is used to build this model.
The Project is divided in the following sections:</description>

      <title>Boston AirBnB Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p1-boston-airbnb-dataanalysis/</link>

      <guid>https://alagrine.github.io/post/p1-boston-airbnb-dataanalysis/</guid>
      <description>Project overview: In this project, I leveraged the Cross Industry Process for DataMining (CRISP-DM), a process used for many data science problems.
I explored the Boston Airbnb open dataset, available here, to get insights into the following questions:
How does seasonality affect AirBnB prices in Boston? How does location affect AirBnB prices? What are the most important features to predict AirBnB prices? What is the relationship between reviews and price? The dataset describes AirBnB activity, including full descriptions of 3585 listings, 68275 reviews, and daily prices and availability from September 2016 to September 2017.</description>
